# Heart Attack Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - 92% Accuracy.

## Introduction

Heart attack prediction is a crucial application of machine learning in healthcare. This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical attributes.

### Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project contains multiple features related to heart health, including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other risk factors.

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values

- Encoding categorical variables

- Feature scaling and normalization

- Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

### Model Architecture

- Input Layer: Number of features as input neurons

- Hidden Layers: Multiple layers with activation functions

- Output Layer: Single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification

### Model Training

- Optimizer: Adam

- Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy

- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

### Model Evaluation

- Confusion Matrix

- ROC Curve and AUC Score

### Classification Report

#### Final Results:
